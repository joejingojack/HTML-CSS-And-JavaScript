/*
 Problem:
  You are working for an online retail company. Your task is to write a JavaScript program that tracks the stock levels of various products in the inventory. The program should check if a product is in stock and log an appropriate message.

	Input details:

		- An array of objects representing products. Each object contains:
		- product: Name of the product (string)
		- stock: Number of units available in stock (integer)

	Output details:

		- A message for each product indicating whether the product is in stock or out of stock.
		
	Steps to implement:

		1. Define an array of product objects with at least 3 sample products
		2. Write a function checkStockLevels that takes this array as input
		3. Use a loop to iterate through the array and check the stock level for each product
		4. Print a message indicating if the product is "In Stock" or "Out of Stock"
		
	Hints:
	
	- The products array contains objects with product and stock properties.
	- Use a loop to iterate through the products array and check the stock level for each product.
	- If the stock is greater than 0, log "In Stock"; otherwise, log "Out of Stock".

function checkStockLevels(products) {
    for (let i = 0; i < products.length; i++) {
        if (products[i].stock > 0) {
            console.log(`${products[i].product} is In Stock.`);
        } else {
            console.log(`${products[i].product} is Out of Stock.`);
        }

}
checkStockLevels(products);
